# Untold Engine

## Introduction

**The Untold Engine: An easy to use, open source, 3D game engine for iOS/macOS.**

Hi, my name is [Harold Serrano](http://www.haroldserrano.com), and I developed the [Untold Engine](http://www.untoldengine.com), an open source 3D game engine written in C++ and Metal Graphics (API).

I took the bold step of rewriting the Untold Engine from scratch, discarding 99% of the previous code to make way for superior, more efficient implementations. As a result, if you were accustomed to the old version of the engine, I regret to inform you that it has been entirely replaced. The new version has seamlessly overwritten the previous features, ushering in a fresh era of enhanced performance and capabilities. Additionally, stay tuned for upcoming feature additions in the coming weeks, designed to further enhance the engine's role as a learning platform.

## Contributing to Untold Engine

Since this project has barely been released as an open-source, I am not taking Pull-Request yet. I want to complete the documentation and write more tutorials before allowing Pull-Request.

If you want to help out, I would appreciate if you could report back any bugs you encounter. Make sure to report them at our [Github issues](https://github.com/untoldengine/UntoldEngine/issues), so we all have access to them.

Thank you.

Once I feel that the documentation is ready, I will allow Pull-Request.
