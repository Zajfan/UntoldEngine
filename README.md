# Untold Engine

## Introduction

**The Untold Engine: An easy to use, open source, 3D game engine for iOS/macOS.**

Hi, my name is [Harold Serrano](http://www.haroldserrano.com), and I developed the [Untold Engine](http://www.untoldengine.com), an open source 3D game engine written in C++ and Metal Graphics (API).


From its origins as an iOS/macOS game engine, the Untold Engine has undergone a meaningful transformation. Today, it serves a new purpose - as a learning platform for rendering enthusiasts and aspiring engineers who are driven by the ambition to become the best in the field. Rather than showcasing itself as a product, it opens its doors for inquisitive minds to dissect and understand rendering techniques deeply. Dive into the inner workings of computer graphics, explore the 'whys' and 'hows,' and embark on your journey towards mastering Rendering. Our game engine is now a humble companion on your quest to unlock the secrets of this fascinating field.

I took the bold step of rewriting the Untold Engine from scratch, discarding 99% of the previous code to make way for superior, more efficient implementations. As a result, if you were accustomed to the old version of the engine, I regret to inform you that it has been entirely replaced. The new version has seamlessly overwritten the previous features, ushering in a fresh era of enhanced performance and capabilities. Additionally, stay tuned for upcoming feature additions in the coming weeks, designed to further enhance the engine's role as a learning platform.

## Contributing to Untold Engine

Since this project has barely been released as an open-source, I am not taking Pull-Request yet. I want to complete the documentation and write more tutorials before allowing Pull-Request.

If you want to help out, I would appreciate if you could report back any bugs you encounter. Make sure to report them at our [Github issues](https://github.com/untoldengine/UntoldEngine/issues), so we all have access to them.

Thank you.

Once I feel that the documentation is ready, I will allow Pull-Request.
